Instead of layers, you stack <code>Pipe</code> objects inside a <code>PipeLine</code> and use the <code>flow</code> method similar to Keras <code>predict</code> function to process a pandas <code>DataFrame</code> through each step. This makes data transformations simple and consistent.</p>"},{"location":"#motivation","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>The motivation behind <code>plmbr</code> comes from the need to streamline data processing in machine learning and data-driven applications. Preparing data often takes significant time, especially when the desired structure is known but the raw data is far from it. plmbr was created to make this transformation process more organized and efficient.</p>"},{"location":"#contribute","title":"Contribute","text":"<p>This is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the community.
